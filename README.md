# hypermedia.systems

Following along with the examples from the book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems).

The code here is slightly different from the book, as I try to use types where I can, and check for them using [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a static type checker for Python.

## Running an Example

Clone the repo...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliojimenez/hypermedia.systems
```
Go to an example...
```bash
cd chapter-3/1-simple-hello-world/
```
And run it...
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```
